# podcasting
We are launching a podcast on open science showing its advantages in research. Most of the episodes will be the interviews with researchers who had published a paper using open science in any form, such as open data or open source programs, and accomplished useful results. The research will be simplified to be understandable for the researchers in other fields or the general public.

Update: We now have a website (http://blog.colperscience.com/) and a functional RSS feed for the podcast (http://feeds.feedburner.com/ColperScience). Episode 1 is already online.
